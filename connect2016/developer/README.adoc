= Couchbase 2016 Connect Workshops

The developer workshop will take you from zero-to-application in a day. You'll start by learning how to install and configure Couchbase Server locally
or in the cloud. Once you have Couchbase Server running, you'll learn how to execute basic N1QL queries and how to start writing code with the SDK of your
choice (Java, Node, and .NET will be covered). We'll build a full stack CRUD application using Angular, and discuss SDK design patterns. Finally, we'll
look at how to create a basic Couchbase Cluster. This is an all-day workshop.

Workshops will be 9am â€“ 3pm. 45 min lunch break, 15 min morning and afternoon break.

Target Audience: broad range of developers interested in using Couchbase
Objective: get developers up to speed to build an application with Couchbase Server
Requirements:
* Reliable wifi for the AWS/Cloud workshop
* Thumb drives to distribute installation files/source code

== 1. Start Couchbase - 9-10a

In this workshop, we will be learning how to do a simple installation of Couchbase Server. We will be going from nothing
to a single node cluster. Instructions will be provided for a local install on Windows, OS X, and Ubuntu 12/14 Linux distros.
We will also cover the creation of a Couchbase Server instance on the popular cloud hosting platforms AWS and Azure.
Finally, we will go over a single node installation in a Docker container (using Docker, Docker for Windows, or Docker for Mac).
When this session is complete, you will be ready for the next workshop.

* Running on Desktop
* Running on AWS / Azure
* Running on Docker

== 2. Using Couchbase - 10:15a - 11:15a

In this workshop, we will be going over some basic developer interactions with Couchbase Server. You'll learn about how
to write and execute basic N1QL (SQL for JSON) queries in both the new Query Workbench and the cbq command line utility.
We will also write a very simple program using the Couchbase SDK. This program will create a new document and store it in
Couchbase, and it will also execute a N1QL query and display the results. Instructions will be provided for popular programming
languages including: Java, Node.js, and .NET.

* Query Workbench / cbq
* SDK Sample (.NET / Java / Node / maybe PHP)

== 3. Building an Application - 12p - 1:45p

In this workshop, we will be building a full stack web application. We will be using Angular to create the UI, and it will
make REST calls to a backend that interacts with Couchbase Server. Popular frameworks and languages will be covered, including
ASP.NET WebAPI, Express.js, and Spring. We will continue discussing N1QL, and we'll also look at basic data modeling. Finally, we
will look at some common design patterns for using the SDK in popular languages including: Java, Node.js, and .NET.

* Use an Angular frontend
* Use .NET / Node / Java backend (maybe PHP)
* Discuss data modeling
* N1QL
* SDK design patterns: async, timeouts, error handling

== 4. Sample Couchbase Cluster - 2p - 3p

In this workshop, we will create a simple Couchbase Server cluster with multiple nodes. We will create a three node cluster
through using Docker containers, and popular cloud services AWS and Azure. Instructions will be provided for doing this with
your choice of Docker, Amazon, or Azure.

* Simple docker cluster
* Simple Amazon cluster
* Simple Azure cluster
